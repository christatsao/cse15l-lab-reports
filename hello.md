Today, the basic filesystem commands we covered are `cd`, `ls`, and `cat`. 
Below are illustrated examples of using each commands with no arguments:

#`cd`

`[user@sahara ~]$ cd`

- This command when used with no arguments takes you back to the root directory. The above command was executed in the root directory already, but below is an example that is executed inside 'home/lecture1/messages`.
  
```
[user@sahara ~]$ cd lecture1/messages/
[user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$ cd
[user@sahara ~]$ pwd
/home
```
